#v0_4

The Arcade Owners stumbled upon a forgotten *Commodore 64*. They enclosed it in a custom cabinet and developed a program to control the gallery's configurations. This retro-meets-modern integration permits anyone with a coin to configure the Arcade Gallery functions.

Also you can continue configuring the game using the [[AGE configuration using files]] method as usual too.

## Capabilities

* Configure `global` and `individual` settings: allow the user to apply settings for all rooms or to a specific one.
* [[Teleportation]] to any room.
* Controls configuration: allows the user to change the [[Controllers]] behavior (gamepad or Quest controls) for a game or for all the games.  The visual configuration allow the user to change the Controller configuration without the need to change the [[YAML]] config files. Read the [[Controller configuration]] for detailed information.
* Cabinet replacement: allows the user to place any cabinet in any position in the room.
