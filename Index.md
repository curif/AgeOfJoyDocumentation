# AGE of Joy

## Documentation

AGE of Joy require some work to start. I suggest to read the [[Documentation]]. 

## Cabinets

### Packs

A cabinet pack is a group of cabinets packed for distribution. You can read in [[How to get and deploy cabinets assets]] about the installation in your Quest. You can also [[Short guide to make cabinets]]  if you can't find what you need.

> [!note] there are a lot of cabinets made by the community not listed here. Join to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/b83ykCM9Xp) server to get them. You will need to dig in messages groups to catch new cabinets.

## About [[ROM]]s

> [!warning]  üëÆüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ROMs are copyrighted material, check it on the internet. It's not allowed to distribute any illegal material in any way, and please, don‚Äôt ask where to find roms or anything related.

If you have a question about a [[ROM]] or a problem with a rom please post a question in [Discord](https://discord.gg/b83ykCM9Xp)

AGE of Joy uses [[MAME]]. [[ROM]]s that are compatible with the [[MAME#Cores]] libretro version should work. However, there are differences and compatibility issues in the implementation in AGE of Joy: some game picture formats don‚Äôt work, sound issues, performance, etc. can affect the correct ROM behavior. There are a _[MAME 2003-Plus Reference: Full Non-Merged Romsets](https://www.google.com/search?q=MAME+2003-Plus+Reference%3A+Full+Non-Merged+Romsets&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)_ on internet for your information

To confirm if your ROM is the same used to test the game use [this tool](https://curif.github.io/AgeOfJoy-ROMCRC/index.html) üëàüèº please compare yours with the `MD5 hash` information in the game page in this site.

If a game you own is not listed, it does not mean that the game cannot run. It simply has not been tested or there is no cabinet to hold it.
